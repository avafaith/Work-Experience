Short's Travel Management Intern: During this internship, I condensed and cleaned data before extracting information for efficient results. I also evaluated and analyzed 800+ rows of complex data to minimize the number of buses needed in each state. From this, I was able to generate yearly calendars and other visualizations to organize my results.

Edell, Shapiro & Finan Intern: In this position, I evaluated paper-based legal files to extract specific information.
